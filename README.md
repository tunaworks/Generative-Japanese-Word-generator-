# Generative JP Word Generator

Generates random Japanese-like words (with some hard-coded phrasing rules).

## Usage

Run `python word_v2.py` to create a list of random words.

## Settings

You can change:
- `WORD_LENGTH` = number of syllables
- `WORDS_GENERATED` = how many words to make
- `STARTS_WITH` = first sound (empty for any)
- `ENDS_WITH` = last sound (empty for any)

Output saves to `word_output.txt` in the same relative directory.
